    "Hence, the assignment `y=x` sets indeed the two names (`x` and `y`) to refer to the same location of memory. However, when `x=2` is executed, the name `x` is rebound to a different value. Part of the reason is that numbers are **immutable**, *e.g.*, their value cannot be changed. This means that the memory location storing `1` cannot be updated, and thus, when executing `x=2`, Python allocates the value `2` in a new location in memory, then rebinds name `x` to the new value. Numbers, strings and tuples are common examples of immutable variables. "
