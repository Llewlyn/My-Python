# My-Python
A collection of Jupyther notebooks to illustrate cool things about Python that I did not know about, or found surprising, 
coming from a C background.


`names_and_variables`: *mutable/immutable* variables and argument passing.

`closures`: how to use (and avoid) Python *closures*.

`iterator`: sort out confusion between *iterable*, *iterator* (and *generator*).
